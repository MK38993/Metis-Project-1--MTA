# Metis Project 1: MTA
 
## Question/need:
What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

In 2020, foot traffic in New York City decreased dramatically due to COVID-19 lockdowns. As a result, retail businesses in New York City saw a massive reduction in customers, and many closed or moved online. Shopping malls that once flourished became deserted.

Since then, vaccines for COVID have become available, allowing people to once again move freely around the city. Retail businesses are expected to grow as well, and many entrepeneurs are searching for locations that receive large amounts of foot traffic, but are reasonably priced.

This is where MTA data comes in. The subway system was hit hard by COVID, as people chose to take other methods of transport for fear of catching the disease in the small, often-crowded tunnels. Now that the U.S. is opening up again, the subway is seeing more use. The increase in subway traffic directly affects foot traffic near stations, and can help entrepeneurs decide where to open a business.

## Data Description:
What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data? What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

I plan to analyze MTA data of the traffic through its stations to find which stations are seeing increased use, and correlate this information with property prices near these stations. This will help entrepreneurs determine which area of New York City to open a business to gain the most foot traffic for reasonable rent levels. 



## Tools:
I have already used SQL to select the data that I plan to analyze with Pandas and display with matplotlib.
