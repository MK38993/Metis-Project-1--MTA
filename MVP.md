# Metis Project 1: MTA Data
 
## Question/need:
In 2020, foot traffic in New York City decreased dramatically due to COVID-19 lockdowns. As a result, retail businesses in New York City saw a massive reduction in customers, and many closed or moved online. Shopping malls that once flourished became deserted.
Since then, vaccines for COVID have become available, allowing people to once again move freely around the city. Retail businesses are expected to grow as well, and many entrepreneurs are searching for locations that receive large amounts of foot traffic, but are reasonably priced.
This is where MTA data comes in. The subway system was hit hard by COVID, as people chose to take other methods of transport for fear of catching the disease in the small, often-crowded tunnels. Now that the U.S. is opening up again, the subway is seeing more use. The increase in subway traffic directly affects foot traffic near stations and can help entrepreneurs decide where to open a business.
## Data Description:
I plan to analyze MTA data of the traffic through its stations to find which stations are seeing increased use and correlate this information with property prices near these stations. This will help entrepreneurs determine which area of New York City to open a business to gain the most foot traffic for reasonable rent levels.
## Tools:
I have already used SQL to select the data that I plan to analyze with Pandas and display my findings with matplotlib.
