# Metis Project 1: MTA - MVP 

### Analyzing and estimating ridership in New York City

The goal of this project is to understand how MTA ridership was affected by COVID-19 lockdowns and to estimate the trajectory of its recovery.

To achieve this goal, I began by calculating monthly MTA ridership for the past two years.

To see which areas were most affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns, I created an animated gif of the relative traffic through each station. The gif can be found below:

While ridership is still less than a third of what it used to be, it has recovered significantly over the past year.
